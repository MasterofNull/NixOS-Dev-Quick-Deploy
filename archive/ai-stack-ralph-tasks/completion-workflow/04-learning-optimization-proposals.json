  "prompt": "Implement learning-based optimization proposal system in ai-stack/mcp-servers/hybrid-coordinator/continuous_learning.py. Add analyze_and_propose_optimizations() function that: (1) Reads telemetry from ~/.local/share/nixos-ai-stack/telemetry/ralph-events.jsonl, (2) Detects patterns: tasks hitting max_iterations >80% of limit (optimization needed), common error patterns (>3 occurrences), timeout issues (>5s response times), (3) Generates optimization proposals as Ralph task JSON with require_approval=True. Add extract_failure_patterns() to group similar errors using fuzzy matching. When pattern detected, auto-submit optimization task to Ralph API at http://ralph-wiggum:8098/tasks with prompt describing the fix. Log all proposals to telemetry. Run analysis every LEARNING_PROCESSING_INTERVAL (3600s). Add tests verifying pattern detection and task generation.",
