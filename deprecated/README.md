# Deprecated Files

This directory contains deprecated files from previous versions of the NixOS Dev Quick Deploy project.

## Structure

Files are organized to preserve their original location in the repository:
- Root level files → `deprecated/`
- Documentation → `deprecated/docs/`

## Contents

### Old Script Versions (v3.0.0)
- **nixos-quick-deploy-v3.0.0.old** - Monolithic v3.0.0 script (replaced by v4.0.0 modular architecture)
- **nixos-quick-deploy.sh.backup-v3.0.0** - Backup of v3.0.0 script

### Development Documentation (v3.x → v4.0.0 Migration)
These documents were created during the v3.0.0 → v4.0.0 refactoring process and are preserved for historical reference:

- **CODE_REVIEW.md** - Initial code review of v3.0.0
- **CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md** - Findings from code review
- **COMPREHENSIVE_CODE_REVIEW.md** - Comprehensive code analysis
- **MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md** - Proposal for modular architecture (implemented in v4.0.0)
- **FIXES_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Implementation notes
- **IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS.md** - Suggestions for improvements (implemented)

## Why Deprecated?

These files are no longer needed for the current v4.0.0 workflow but are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding the evolution of the project
- Potential rollback scenarios
- Learning from past architectural decisions

## Current Documentation

For current, active documentation, see the main `docs/` directory at the repository root.
