# Harness Grounding Supplement — Qwen3-35B

This file is injected into every direct/agent delegation as a system message supplement.
It encodes harness-specific facts the model cannot derive from general training.
Keep entries concise — token cost per delegation is real.

## Commit Format (mandatory)

Pattern: `type(scope): short description`
Example: `fix(dispatch): set frequency_penalty=0.0 to prevent JSON truncation`
Types: feat|fix|docs|refactor|chore|test|ci|perf|style
Trailer: `Co-Authored-By: claude-sonnet-4-6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
CRITICAL: `(scope)` is NOT optional. `fix: description` is wrong. Always include it.

## Tool Result Messages

Tool result messages MUST use `role: "tool"`. Using `role: "function"` causes the message to
be silently dropped by the Qwen3 chat template — the model never sees the result and
hallucinates on all subsequent turns. Always: `{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "...", "content": "..."}`.

## AppArmor Rules

- SQLite databases: `rwk` (read+write+lock). `c` is INVALID — `rwkc` fails `apparmor_parser`.
- File rules do NOT cover `mkdir()`. Directory creation needs a separate explicit rule.
- `NoNewPrivileges=true` in systemd blocks `Ux`/`Px` transitions → use `ix` only.
- After profile changes: check `journalctl -u apparmor.service` for syntax errors.
- Nix store paths in AppArmor: use `/nix/store/**/rest/of/path` glob, NOT the full hash path.

## Frequency Penalty

`frequency_penalty != 0.0` applies cumulative logit penalties. In dense JSON where `"`
appears 300+ times, the penalty reaches 15.0 → `"` becomes unprintable → early EOS
at ~line 59-61. ALWAYS use `frequency_penalty=0.0` for structured/code output.
Loop protection: use `repeat_penalty=1.08` + `repeat_last_n=64` (sliding window) instead.

## Ports and Service URLs

ALL service ports come from `nix/modules/core/options.nix` — never hardcode.
Current defaults: llama.cpp=8080, embed=8081, AIDB=8002, coordinator=8003,
switchboard=8085, cli-bridge=8089, dashboard=8889.
Python reads from env vars; shell scripts use `${PORT:-default}`.

## NixOS Constraints

- GPU layers ceiling: `--n-gpu-layers 12` (Renoir APU, 4 GB shared VRAM). Never suggest >12.
- `enable_thinking` must be in `chat_template_kwargs`, NOT top-level — top-level is silently ignored.
- `sops.secrets.*` entries MUST be immediately followed by `sops <file>` to add the matching key.
  Mismatch = `setupSecrets failed (1)` at boot = `/run/secrets/` absent = full stack down.
- Secrets/API keys NEVER go in tracked Nix files. Only `deploy-options.local.nix` is gitignored.

## AIDB Collections (real names — NOT stale training data)

Valid collections: `error-solutions`, `best-practices`, `skills-patterns`, `codebase-context`,
`agent-interactions`, `training-data`, `task-history`, `model-evaluations`,
`harness-patterns`, `system-telemetry`, `performance-metrics`, `code-patterns`,
`nixos-patterns`, `agent-memory`.
For bug patterns and fixes: use `error-solutions`. NOT `solved_issues` (stale, does not exist).

## Python Async Pattern

File I/O inside `async def` aiohttp/FastAPI handlers MUST be non-blocking:
- `aiofiles.open(path)` for async file reads
- `asyncio.to_thread(sync_fn, ...)` for wrapping sync I/O
- NEVER `open(path).read()` directly inside `async def` — blocks the event loop.

## Timestamped Monitor Pattern (standard for all long-running agentic tasks)

Every Monitor arm for a long-running multi-step task MUST prefix events with an ISO 8601
UTC timestamp so elapsed time between events is immediately readable.

Standard wrapper (pipe after any grep/filter):
```bash
| while IFS= read -r line; do printf "[%s] %s\n" "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "$line"; done
```

Full example — watch a batch processor log:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/run.log | grep -E --line-buffered "progress|FAIL|done" \
  | while IFS= read -r line; do printf "[%s] %s\n" "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "$line"; done
```

Rules:
- Apply this wrapper to EVERY Monitor command — no exceptions for long-running tasks.
- Long-running scripts (batch processors, training loops, deploy scripts) must also prefix
  their own `print()` / `echo` output with `$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)` at the source.
- When re-arming a monitor (e.g. after a session break), stop the old monitor via TaskStop
  before arming the new one to avoid duplicate untimstamped events.

## Loop Completion Signal (aq-loop outer orchestration)

When a task is dispatched via `aq-loop`, the outer loop expects this exact completion signal
as your FINAL response after store_memory returns success:

  COMPLETED: <what was done in one sentence>

- Output ONLY that line. No JSON, no tool calls, no markdown.
- Omitting this signal causes aq-loop to classify the iteration as incomplete and retry.
- Do NOT output COMPLETED: before the task is actually done (tier0 passed + committed).

## Workflow Phases (ORIENT→COMMIT)

Follow in order. Never skip or reorder:
1. ORIENT   — get_hint(query) first. Read RESUME.json if available.
2. RESEARCH — query_aidb(collection='error-solutions'). Max 4 read_file per slice.
3. PLAN     — one sentence: 'Fixing: <title> — <description>'
4. EXECUTE  — edit_file over write_file. One targeted change per slice.
5. VERIFY   — validate_before_commit; fix failures; re-run tier0 gate.
6. DOC-UPDATE — mark [OPEN]→[DONE] in .agent/memory/issues-backlog.md if applicable.
7. COMMIT   — git_add + git_commit; then store_memory → then COMPLETED: signal.
