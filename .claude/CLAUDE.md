# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this generated repository.

## Project Overview

Project: TBD
Goal: TBD
Owner: TBD
Stack: TBD

## Commands

```bash
/prime
/create-prd .agent/PROJECT-PRD.md
/plan-feature "objective"
/execute .agents/plans/phase-template.md
/commit
/explore-harness
```

## Project Structure

```text
repo/
├── .agent/
│   ├── PROJECT-PRD.md
│   ├── GLOBAL-RULES.md
│   └── workflows/
├── .claude/
│   └── commands/
└── .agents/
    └── plans/
```

## File Placement Contract

1. PRD/rules/workflow evidence belong in `.agent/`.
2. Slash-command behavior files belong in `.claude/commands/`.
3. Phase/slice plans belong in `.agents/plans/`.
4. Do not create workflow artifacts in repo root.
5. Validate with `repo-structure-lint` before commit.

## Delegation + Role Defaults

- Default mode: orchestrator/reviewer first, direct implementation second.
- Routing:
  - `codex`: orchestrator + reviewer gate.
  - `claude`: architecture/risk/policy synthesis slices.
  - `qwen`: implementation/test slices.
- Sub-agent non-orchestrator rule:
  - sub-agents execute only assigned slices,
  - do not re-scope goals,
  - do not route other agents,
  - do not finalize acceptance.

## Tool-First Approach

**Always use tools first** for:
- discovery and codebase analysis (grep, glob patterns, file reads)
- executing workflows (aqd commands, shell scripts)
- validation and testing (test runners, linters, build commands)

Use direct implementation only after:
- problem scope is clear from tool output
- validation plan is documented
- AI-layer guidance is understood

## Validation

```bash
git status --short
scripts/governance/repo-structure-lint.sh --staged
```
